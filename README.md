# Weather-Dashboard
 
 This homework assignment was tuff, im still having trouble saving data to the server so it remembers the data you inputed before. It was also hard to call data from live server. I will be looking over my notes and vids to come up and understand it better.https://rcsanchez1.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/
